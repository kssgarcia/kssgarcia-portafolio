## Adding New Projects

To add new projects to the portfolio, you need to update the `Projects.json` file located in `src/assets`. Hereâ€™s how you can add a new project:

### Step 1: Update the Projects JSON

1. Open the `Projects.json` file. You will see an array of project objects.
2. Add a new object to the array with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": "project-id",
    "title": "Project Title",
    "description": "A brief description of the project.",
    "imageUrl": "path/to/image.jpg",
    "techStack": ["Technology1", "Technology2", "Technology3"],
    "githubUrl": "https://github.com/yourusername/project",
    "liveUrl": "https://example.com/project"

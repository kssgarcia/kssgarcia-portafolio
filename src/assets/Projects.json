As a member of the project team, I contributed to various critical aspects of the station's development, utilizing SolidWorks for parts design and engaging in finite element method (FEM) analysis to ensure structural integrity and efficiency. Our goal was to optimize the solar tracking mechanism, which involved a detailed study of the state of the art in supplier technologies and the strategic use of a linear actuator. By meticulously analyzing and selecting the optimal assembly points for the actuator, we achieved a highly efficient tracking system that operates with minimized energy consumption. This optimization process not only enhanced the operational effectiveness of the solar tracker but also extended its longevity and reduced maintenance needs. The project's success is marked by its innovative approach to maximizing solar energy capture through precise movement and positioning of the solar panels. This initiative not only supports sustainable energy efforts but also serves as a benchmark for future advancements in solar tracking technologies. The collaborative efforts and findings from this project continue to influence ongoing research and development in renewable energy systems, underpinning EAFIT University's commitment to pioneering engineering solutions."
